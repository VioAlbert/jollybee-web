    <h1>Your starting point</h1>
    <p>
    There are various ways to start your CP journey.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    For newcomers with no coding experience, we recommend learning from the <a
      href="https://tlx.toki.id/courses/basic">TLX basic programming courses</a> prepared by TOKI.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    Already have coding experience? We recommend you to try their <a
      href="https://tlx.toki.id/courses/competitive">basic CP courses</a> for more challenging topics.

    <h1>Spice it up with Online Judges</h1>
    <p>
    Participate in live online contests. We suggest trying <a href="https://atcoder.jp/contests/archive?ratedType=1&category=0&keyword=">Atcoder Beginner Contest</a>, <a href="https://codeforces.com/contests?type=div4">Codeforces Div. 4</a>, and <a href="https://codeforces.com/contests?type=div3">Codeforces Div. 3</a> for starters to experience how it feels to be in a real CP competition. We don't recommend doing this before you've finished <a href="https://tlx.toki.id/courses/basic">TLX's introductory courses</a>.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2>Our Online Judge recommendations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://codeforces.com/">Codeforces</a>

      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h2>Some things to remember</h2>
    <p>If you can't solve any problems in a contest, don't be discouraged. Try our recommended courses above and practice some more.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Everyone started out as a newbie; it's just that you've only just taken your first step in CP. Don't worry, our selection phases are designed for starters in basic programming.</p>
